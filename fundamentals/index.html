    <h2>What is network booting?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_boot">Network booting</a>,
    or booting from LAN as it is also called, is a process which allows a computer
    to start up and load an operating system or other program directly from the
    network without any locally attached storage device, like a floppy, CDROM,
    USB stick or hard drive.
    </p>
    <p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_architecture">Intel
    architecture</a> computers this is made possible with the <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment">PXE</a> standard.
    PXE extends the features of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">BIOS</a>
    so that it can run software directly from the network. PXE support is now so common that you
    can expect it to be present in any reasonably modern computer that comes
    with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_connector#8P8C">Ethernet
    jack</a> (commonly known as RJ45).
    </p>
    <p>This fact alone makes it possible to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booting">boot</a>
    an Intel-based computer from the network without having to burn an EEPROM on your
    network card, like you had to do in the past.

    <h2>The BIOS boot process</h2>
    <p>
     When your computer powers on and starts running your operating system,
     it goes through a series of operations before it actually starts your
     operating system.  Your operating system is a very sophisticated boot
     program that takes total control over your computer.  But a boot
     program can also be a fairly simple program, like a memory diagnostics
     program, a hardware stability checker, or even a simple game like Pong
     or Tetris.
    </p>
    <dl>
     <dt>Power On</dt>
     <dd>When you put power on your computer and press the <em>On</em> button
     on the case.</dd>

     <dt>Initialize hardware</dt>
     <dd>The BIOS performs an inventory of all the components in the
     computer, such as the CPU, memory chips, extension cards, storage
     controllers, etc.</dd>

     <dt>Run self-tests</dt>
     <dd>All of the components discovered goes through a self-test
     procedure, to ensure they are operating properly. If any of the
     components fail, and that component is required for basic operation,
     your computer will usually make a series of beeps and stop functioning.
     When all problems have been fixed the BIOS will move on to the next
     step in the process, which is to discover additional option ROMs.</dd>

     <dt>Computer stopped</dt>
     <dd>If your computer ends up in this state, it will either hang
     forever, or it will turn itself off. This depends on how it entered
     this state, and how your BIOS is configured to react when it reaches
     this state.</dd>

     <dt>Discover built-in devices and option ROMs</dt>
     <dd>During this activity, your BIOS will discover all of the extensions
     available.  BIOS extensions are usually included in the firmware of
     your BIOS or burned into an EEPROM or flash chip on one of your add-on
     cards.  During booting you can normally notice this as your IDE, SATA,
     SCSI or other controllers finding the devices that are attached to
     them.  For network cards, this is usually when you see the prompt that
     lets you specify what kind of boot protocol it should support (like PXE
     or RPL).  Option ROMs should usually not do anything fancy at this
     point, except initialize hardware, run self-tests and set up boot
     service (BBS) entry points.  Once all extensions have been allowed to
     run and add their boot service entry points, control goes back to the
     BIOS.  At this point all the add-on cards and internal services of the
     BIOS have been initialized and are ready to do work.  All of the boot
     service entry points are ordered according to the configuration
     specified in the BIOS.  It is quite common that the user is given a
     choice of which boot service to try first by pressing a hotkey.  F12 is
     a common key to start a boot service offered by a network card, but
     this varies among manufacturers.  Once the first boot service has been
     selected, either manually or automatically, control moves to the next
     step.</dd>

     <dt>Start first boot service in BIOS boot services list</dt>
     <dd>During this stage, the program indicated by the boot service
     entry point is started. At this point, control passes to the boot
     service program, which starts its discovery process for a boot
     program.</dd>

     <dt>Boot service performs discovery for boot program</dt>

     <dd>Different boot services go about looking for the boot program in
     different ways.  A floppy controller will read the first sector of the
     floppy and get ready to start that piece of code.  A hard-drive (HDD)
     controller will usually read the master boot record (MBR) of the first
     attached HDD and designate that as the boot program.  A network card
     using the PXE standard will perform a DHCP request to find out its IP
     address and location of boot program.  If a location is advertised, a
     TFTP request is performed to fetch the boot program, commonly referred
     to as a network boot program (NBP).  If the boot service was unable
     to find a valid boot program, the boot service will exit and control
     returns back to the BIOS, which will try the next boot service.  If a
     boot program was successfully found, control will be handed over to
     it.</dd>

     <dt>Remove first boot service or put at bottom of list</dt>
     <dd>The BIOS needs to cycle to the next boot service in its list.
     Whether the BIOS discards the current boot service or adds it back at
     the end of the list varies between BIOS vendors. Both methods have pros
     and cons. The next step is to figure out if there are any more boot
     services to try out.</dd>

     <dt>More boot services available?</dt>
     <dd>If there are more boot services available, the next one in line
     will be started. If there are no more boot services the computer will
     halt and perform its halt operation.</dd>

     <dt>Start boot program</dt>
     <dd>At this point the boot program is in full control of the computer,
     and it will start doing whatever it is supposed to do. If the boot
     program detects a problem or wishes to, it can return back to the BIOS.
     This is not a very common thing to do for a boot program, as a lot of
     BIOSes have buggy implementations for getting control back. The more
     common method is just to display a message and hang, or reboot
     instantly. Since the boot program has full control over the computer it
     can make use of all the other devices the BIOS has detected to perform
     whatever action it needs to.</dd>

     <dt>Boot program running</dt>
     <dd>The final part a boot program normally does, is to hand over
     control to an operating system kernel.  A boot program that performs
     this kind of action is usually called a <em>boot loader</em>.  Common
     boot loaders for Linux systems are <strong>grub</strong> and
     <strong>syslinux</strong>.  Before the boot loader does this, it will
     usually also fetch additional data from a storage device, e.g.  drivers
     and configuration files.  Any program code required to operate the
     hardware must be in main memory at this point, or you will be unable to
     access the hardware.  This requirement is usually implemented using
     ramdisks, so that the kernel can be kept modular and flexible.  In
     Linux they are called initial ramdisks (initrds), in Solaris they go by the name boot
     archives, and in recent Windows versions they are called wim files.
     The operating system kernel will then perform a complete discovery of
     the hardware attached to the system (again) and start doing whatever it
     is programmed to do.  At this point, because another piece of code (the
     kernel) is in direct control of the hardware, it would be very unwise
     to switch control back to the BIOS, as hardware state has been modified
     under its feet.</dd>

    <h2>How iPXE extends the network boot process</h2>
    <p>
    <a href="http://ipxe.org/">iPXE</a> is a sophisticated boot
    program that is capable of extending the traditional PXE network
    boot process in several ways.  It can be <a
    href="http://ipxe.org/howto/romburning">flashed</a> as an add-on
    card's option ROM, or it can be loaded as a network boot program
    (NBP) from an existing PXE option ROM via TFTP (this is called <a
    href="http://ipxe.org/howto/chainloading">chainloading</a>).  It
    is also possible to include it as an option ROM inside your BIOS
    or load it from any local storage media, like floppy, USB, CD or
    HDD.
    </p>
    <p>
    Depending on how iPXE is configured, it can load additional boot
    programs from several different sources in addition to TFTP. The
    most common way is to use <strong>HTTP</strong> to load additional
    content using a standard web server.  If your web server supports
    range requests, you can also use it to boot floppies and
    <strong>CD images (ISOs)</strong> directly from the web
    server. <strong>FTP</strong> can also be used in the same
    way. There is even support for encrypted transmission with <a
    href="http://ipxe.org/crypto">HTTPS</a>. It is possible to
    configure it to only allow execution of programs that have been
    signed. If you combine this with ROM-burning you can have a
    network boot loader that will load only <a
    href="http://ipxe.org/cmd/imgverify">trusted code</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of the most interesting features iPXE enables, is to boot a computer
    without an iSCSI host bus adapter from an iSCSI volume.  This is
    possible, because iPXE implements a full-featured software-based <strong>iSCSI
    initiator</strong>.  It even supports CHAP authentication!  For operating systems
    that support it, you can also use <strong>AoE</strong> (ATA Over Ethernet) in addition
    to iSCSI.
    </p>
    <p>
    The final feature that makes iPXE so impressive, is that it also
    has a very advanced <a href="http://ipxe.org/scripting">scripting
    language</a> and
    text-based <a href="http://ipxe.org/cmd/choose">menu system</a>.
    These features enable you to make dynamic boot environments
    without the need to know a server-side scripting language like
    PHP, Perl or Python.
